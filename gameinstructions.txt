After the ships are placed each player will take turns "shooting" torpedos
at each other. If the shot is a hit the player can take another shot until
there is a miss and then it is the opposing players turn. Once the ship has been hit
according to its size (see below) it will show sunk and the "shot board" will change
from X to the mark of the ship. The mark on the shot board for a hit is X and O for
a miss.

A winner is declared after all the opposing player ships are sunk. The ship, size and board marks are listed below.
